# Fitness-Squat-Counter-using-Pose-Estimation-in-OpenCV
I'm excited to share a project where I leveraged computer vision and pose estimation techniques to create a real-time fitness squat tracking system. With the power of OpenCV and a custom "poseModule," this project accurately counts squats performed during a workout, providing valuable feedback to fitness enthusiasts.
